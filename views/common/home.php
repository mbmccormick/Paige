        <h4 style="color: #BFBFBF;">Web-based personnel paging made easy.</h4>
        <p style="line-height: 1.5em;">Paige is a simple web application that enables you to page your IT support department, property management personnel, medical staff, or whatever mission-critical teams your business employs.</p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.5em;">Analog pagers are costly, unreliable, and redundant. Paige makes use of your team's existing mobile phones to deliver important messages and get timely results. You can easily integrate Paige with your existing monitoring systems to ensure instant delivery of your pages.</p>
        <p style="line-height: 1.5em;">Paige is backed by a 99.999% uptime Service Level Agreement, so you can ensure that your paging systems are available when you need them.</p>
